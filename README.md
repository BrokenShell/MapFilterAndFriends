# Map, Filter and Friends


In today's workshop we will see how map and filter work and how to use them effectively in a "real world" example. Map and filter are bread and butter algorithms that belong in every developer's toolbox - right next to sort.


### Key Concepts
- Imperative vs. Declarative
- Map
- Filter
- Comprehensions that act like map and filter (Compound Generator Expression)


### Anecdote
These algorithms have been featured in over half of my software engineering interviews. Sometimes I was the interviewer, and other times I was the interviewee. Paul and Ash (our release managers) had to implement map, filter and foreach for their roles here at BloomTech. This kind of coding challenge is typically timed. I had 45 minutes for one of mine, I implemented all three in three different languages and I still had about 10 minutes left over.
